## Narrow AI - Automated Prompt Engineering and Optimization Platform

Narrow AI can [write, monitor, and optimize prompts](https://www.getnarrow.ai/) for any AI model automatically. That means you can build AI features way faster and cheaper.

We're attempting to solve two main issues:
1. The endless amount of time spent writing, tweaking, and testing prompts for higher accuracy or better content quality. We started this because we found ourselves spending hours and days writing prompts, and felt like there must be a better way. Our initial approach was based on published research using LLMs as prompt writers and reviewers, but we've built quite a bit on top of the initial implementation to improve performance in real-world use cases.
2. The tedious process of testing and re-testing new models as they are released, which is now happening at a very rapid clip. While you can try to simply copy/paste a prompt from one provider or model to another, some model providers react differently to different styles of prompting and moving to smaller, lower reasoning models often requires giving more explicit instructions to achieve the same accuracy at a lower cost and latency.

Here's the cool stuff it does:
- Adapts prompts to new models in minutes
- Balances cost and performance like a pro
- Keeps an eye on your AI's performance 24/7

It's already cutting costs by 95% and turning week-long tasks into day-long wins. Check out [Narrow AI](https://www.getnarrow.ai/) to learn more.
